<h2 class="text-xl">All Organic. All Vegan. All Delicious!</h2>

I created my café and website so you discover how a change in my eating habits created a healthy future for my children and I and it could do the same for you. Back in 2003, I was incapacitated with arthritis affecting my hands, hips and feet. It only took three months to remedy that situation by eating 100% Organic Raw Plant Cuisine. Even today, I’m clear of any pain, even though my mother had rheumatoid arthritis quite severely.

With my daughter’s help, we created more than a café I should say. We offer our Plant Cuisine to eat in and take-out so you can taste the deliciousness of our cuisine. We went even further by offering all of our recipes online, making them easy to prepare and guiding you step-by-step to guaranteed success. At our café, you will also find the ingredients necessary to execute these recipes. We make it simple and easy all the way!

We wish for you to be inspired to unleash the healing power within. You will reap the benefits and so will our children, all beings and our Mother Earth.
