The Juice Truck is Vancouverâ€™s first and original Cold-Pressed Juice Company. You can find our stores in Mount Pleasant, Yaletown, Main St, and Steveston, and our cart at Burrard St and Robson St. You can also order our juice online through our store. We also sell our bottled cold pressed juice at over 30 retail partners across Vancouver and the Lower Mainland.

Juice does some amazing things for your body and health. It's also delicious, refreshing and hydrating, which is every bit as important. Especially the delicious part.

We make the most nutritionally complete juice possible. Our premium cold press makes juice that contains more essential vitamins, minerals and enzymes than juice made any other way. The cold press also preserves the natural flavours of the produce, which we feel makes the juice tastier.
