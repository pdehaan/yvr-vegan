The Arbor is a playful, quick service, two-patio neighbourhood restaurant focused on good times, great drinks and refined indulgences. Its kitchen uses fresh, wild foraged and otherwise real plant-based ingredients to create familiar comfort foods - like the signature Arburger - while its bar program zeroes in on wines, beers and ciders that pair well with a deep fryer. It is the accessible grab-and-go sister/sequel to the award-winning Acorn Restaurant (located on the same block) with the same uncompromising attentions being paid to quality, detail and deliciousness.

## OUR HOUSE IS A VERY, VERY, VERY FINE HOUSE

We use creativity and the abundance afforded to us by local farmers to create great food, plain and simple. We like to draw inspiration from comfort food classics while making the dishes entirely our own. Our food is made from vegetables and we're happy to show off the variety and amazing potential they can offer.

Nearly everything is made in-house from our ketchup and mustard to our award-winning vegan and gluten-free burger patty. You won't find seitan, wheat-gluten or any other imitation meat or substitutes. Not that there's anything wrong with those things... we just think that if you can buy it in a store or make it easily at home, why order it in a restaurant?
