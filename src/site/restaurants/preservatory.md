We be ‘jammin’.…all year round at The Preservatory – a place for creation! A farm based artisanal food production company, specializing in seasonal preserves. The Preservatory preserves are made in copper kettles using traditional cooking methods and innovative flavour pairings. Using ‘at their peak’ in-season fruits, much of which is grown right on our farm, Vista D’oro. Our delicious and versatile preserves are meant for pairing and sharing; served on a cheese board, as a glaze for roast meats or simply alongside fresh baked scones. We’ve been proudly making fruit shine since 2002.

Our preserves, which are far from ordinary, take old favourites to new heights and different flavours are created for each season, highlighting the in-season locally grown fruit found at Vista D’oro and other farms throughout the province of BC in Canada.

The Preservatory is owned and operated by Lee Murphy and her partner and husband, Patrick is the winemaker and farmer who supplies all the fresh fruit for the delicious preserves. Our preserves have been featured in Country Living magazine, enRoute, Canadian Living, and many other publications, and are available across North America, Harrods of London and other fine retailers in Europe.

Vista D’oro Farms & Winery is located in South Langley, BC, Canada – a culinary destination, attracting thousands of visitors each year. Only 5 minutes from the USA border and 45 minutes south of Vancouver. Vista D’oro overlooks the meadows and trees of Campbell Valley Park and the position of the farm allows for an amazing view of the Golden Ears Mountains. Hence, the golden view or, for those with an Italian influence, Vista D’oro. The property also boasts a beautiful craftsman style Carriage House that is home to The Preservatory. The produce grown on Vista D’oro is used in every aspect of the operation, showcasing the superiority of local, farm-fresh ingredients.
