The NAAM Cafe was founded in the Heart of Kitsilano back in 1968 when Fourth Avenue was still called Rainbow Road. Originally, it was created as a gathering place where people could come enjoy "the good life". By staying small, we remain true to that original vision, using fresh and pure ingredients while maintaining a warm, homey and welcoming, family-run atmosphere. We’re a very busy full-service vegetarian restaurant located in the heart of Vancouver’s Kitsilano district and are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for your dining pleasure. The only day we close is on Christmas day!

We do not take reservations, and instead operate on a first-come-first-serve basis.

Enjoy our locally-made tofu and tempeh, free-range eggs, organic Yukon Gold potatoes from the Fraser Valley, pure organic Canadian maple syrup, organic blueberries and much more!
