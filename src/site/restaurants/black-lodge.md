Located in Mount Pleasant, The Black Lodge is a fully licensed, open late nights and completely vegetarian (with lots of vegan and gluten free options!)

<!--more-->

Since moving locations in September 2018, we now offer 65 seats, and expanded food alcohol selections to serve you better! Weâ€™ve got lots of local and BC craft beer and wine and a large original cocktail list to keep you coming back. Come check out our full vegetarian menu, with almost all menu items available to be made vegan. We offer many gluten free options as well as a nut free menu and kitchen to serve guests with nut allergies!

Our original location, near Fraser and Kingsway, opened May 2013, and has since relocated to a larger location, situated at East Broadway and Scotia St. Come check out or new spot and try out some of our reinvented menu items!
