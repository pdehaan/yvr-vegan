The original Workshop Vegetarian Cafe was established in the fall of 2016 on a cozy corner of Pemberton and 3rd Street with the mountains as our backdrop in North Vancouver. We opened our second location in East Vancouver in July 2018. Our Japanese inspired menu provides what we’re best known for: delicious, wholesome, plant based, and handcrafted vegetarian and vegan fare. From our signature ramen and udon noodle bowls, to our buddha bowls with rice and miso gravy, and smashed avocado toast on our organic natural yeast bread, we provide options for everyone for all meals of the day.

We wanted to show just how delicious vegetarian and vegan fare could be, while also using organic and local ingredients where possible. Our dishes are prepared and presented with lots of love and care, and we hope you come to our cafe and feel nourished. We are a team of Chefs, Artisans, Bakers, Nutritionists, Educators, Personal Trainers and Outdoor Enthusiasts. Together, we bring passion and creativity, delivering delicious, wholesome, vegetarian food.

Our promise to you Quality is our promise! We source only the best ingredients- locally grown+organic where possible. We support sustainable farming methods, fair trade+ eco-friendly policies. This is for our environment+ simply to celebrate taste+ sense of place. Our greatest emphasis is to capture the true flavour of each season. Have a happy day! We look forward to seeing you soon!
