## Community. Sustainability. Accessibility.

Sprouts is a 100% volunteer and student-run organization at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Through our many initiatives, we endeavor to make healthy, affordable, and sustainably produced food accessible to everyone on campus.

Our story began in 1997 with the creation of the UBC Natural Food Co-op, a bulk buying food co-operative which in 2004 moved to the SUB and opened Sprouts, a student-run grocery store.
In 2008, Sprouts was renovated and re-opened as a volunteer-run café, store, and community space serving hot lunches, coffee, and baked goods and selling organic, locally-grown produce and minimally-packaged staple and snack items. Sprouts also runs a bulk buying club, a Sprouts box delivery program, and hosts Community Eats, a by-donation lunch on Fridays.

In 2013 seedlings cafe opened in the penthouse of the Thea Koerner House.

After a fundraising campaign renovations to the Life building, Sprouts cafe and grocery location opened in January 2019.

As a non-profit and volunteer-run business, our profitable endeavors – Sprouts cafe and grocery store, and The Sprouts Box – are able to support our educational and outreach programs – Community Eats and Sprouts Workshops. Come visit us and you will find a friendly and warm space where everyone is welcome to enjoy that time-honoured combination of good food and good company.
