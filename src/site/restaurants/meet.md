MeeT Restaurants was founded by three Vancouver restaurant alumni in 2013.

Friends, family and pals sharing time over food & drink is one of the most connective things we can do these days. MeeT intends to show people that comfort food that connects us and nourishes us can be veggie, can be made from scratch, can be delicious and can be a affordable… MeeT is a place that welcomes everyone, and has seat for all people looking to come together and spend time together connecting.

The recipes at MeeT were created by Linda who cut her teeth in the industry at Vij’s, and after culinary school at DV8 - her background also fed into her household recipes - creating sauces and dishes that would be favourites of her Veggie husband and 3 non-veggie boys... no small feat! These sauces and dishes are many of the foundations of MeeT's most popular dishes that continue to be craved by veggies and non-veg alike!
